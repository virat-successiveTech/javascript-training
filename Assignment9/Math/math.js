//3.create a new folder named 'math' and create a file math.js. In math.js, define two functions:
//a. add(a, b): takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
//b. subtract(a, b): takes two numbers as arguments and returns their difference.
// create a new file index.js and just export those functions and then use those function in any of the file

function sum (a,b)
{
   return a+b;
}
function difference (a,b)
{
    if(a>b)
    {
        return a-b;
    }
    else 
    return b-a;
}
export {sum,difference};
